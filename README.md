# Neuro-Symbolic Code Mentor

A next‑level code mentoring tool that analyzes your Python code using both symbolic pattern matching and neural text generation for adaptive suggestions. Built with clean architecture, testing, and even a web interface—this tool is perfect for leveling up your code quality.

## Features

- **Pattern Matching:** Scans for common code anti‑patterns.
- **Neural Suggestions:** Uses a transformer model to provide additional context‑aware advice.
- **CLI & Web Interface:** Analyze code from the command line or via a simple web app.
- **Interactive Tutorial:** Built‑in guide to help you get started.
- **Extensible:** Easily add more patterns or neural features.
